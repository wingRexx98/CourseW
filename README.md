# Enterprize-Development-CW
Course work for COMP1640 Enterprize Development 

Notes:
- Read through Wiki before coding.
- "src": demo folder for frontend.

Setting up the project:
1. Download and setup WAMP (for Windows) and workbench for MySQL
2. Download the zip from master branch. Extract it to C:\wamp64\www\
3. Edit the config.php file according to your MySQL configuration (recommended: "username: root", "password: ''")
4. Execute the populate.sql and tables.sql files. Delete the files in folder upload/word and upload/image. Don't delete the folders!
5. Run the pages directly from browser using the link: http://localhost/CourseW-master/src/login.php

Upload some temp files to start testing :)
